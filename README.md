# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to use SQL to combine numerous CSV files containing employee data. We used the employee data to create lists of employees close to retirement age, and we were able to create different charts to show different variations of retirment data. We were able to see retirement data by age and see how many people were close to retirement by department as well. 

## Analysis

One major point noticed is that the senior staff has a higher amount of people closer to retirement.
